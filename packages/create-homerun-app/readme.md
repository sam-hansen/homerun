# Create Homerun App

The fastest way to setup your own [Homerun](https://github.com/twickd/homerun) repository. To get started, type the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx create-homerun-app
```

Or if you want to specify the name of your application before `create-homerun-app` asks you, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx create-homerun-app my-homerun-app
```

_(Replace `my-homerun-app` with the name of your app)_
